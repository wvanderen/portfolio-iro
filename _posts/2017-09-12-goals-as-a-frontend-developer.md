title: My Goals as a Frontend Developer
---
As I've progressed into programming, I've noticed that what I care the most about is developing my own abilities. Since I started with the goal of starting my own company, much of my goals are related to that. But already, I've come away with a fascination for the discipline and the desire to expand my capabilities as much as I can.

## Build Cool Stuff
As I continue to grow, one of my main goals as a developer is to be able to take what I've learned and apply to it whatever project I'm working on. Over time, I want both the quality and complexity of my work to grow. I'm excited by what I can do already, and everything I've learned so far has gone a long way to helping me build my work for class. Now I hope to apply it to my own work as part of my startup.

## On a Whim
I, for one, think programming is really fun. The idea of being able to build something that wasn't there before excites me. I'd like to get to a point of mastery where I can just sit down, get lost in the code for a while, and come out with something that works. This will allow me a lot more freedom of expression and will allow me to test ideas quickly so I can iterate and find out what works.

## Open Road
Ultimately, I think that software development can be a truly freeing discipline. One of my goals is to get to a point where I'm quite comfortable with the technical aspects so that I can use them as tools by which to innovate. Once a certain degree of mastery is achieved, the process becomes second nature and I can experiment with new ways of doing things. I'm really excited for this as it will allow me to stretch my imagination and help me to keep finding challenges even when the basics are down.
